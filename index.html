            <p>Would it be ok if I took some of your time? Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?<br>
                Would it be ok if I opened my heart?Would it be ok if I took on the part<br><br>
                What you've done, you've illuminated my soul.
                It's you and your love that has made me whole.
                The feel of your love, your soft touch and caress,
                We're tight, so close; your heart beats in my chest.

            <p>You're the one I can't live without.
                This fact is true, I have no doubt.
                I love the way you smile at me.
                I love the way together we're free.
                You may be strange and slightly loony,
                But all this means nothing to me,
                Because you are who you are,
                And I can see your beauty
                Inside and out,
                Which is what threw me.<br><br>
                When every day I see you,
                Till then I cannot wait.
                To know what we will go through
                Is in the hands of fate.
                The first time that I saw you,
                I knew I must steal your heart.
                I hope that it's mine forever
                And that we never do part.<br><br><hr>
                You are the one I love the most,
                And to this here fact, I propose a toast;
                May we grow old and still have fun,
                Because I love you and my heart you've won.</p>

            <p>I forgive you. For the pain you inflicted, for the nights I spent crying over you. For the insecurities you gave me, for the memories you lit on fire. For the mistakes you made that I apologized for. For the friendship you turned into a nightmare. For the nights I spent up wondering what was wrong with me, why I didn't seem to feel worth much to you. For the love you gave, and then the cold shoulder that followed. For the disbelief that laid tight in my chest like a fist. For the smoke that came from your lies, choking me, making me cough up excuses for how you treated me. For the good times times you make me regret. For the talks that meant everything, but mean nothing now. For the truths I'll never be sure were lies or not. For the distrust of love and people you helped instill in me. For saying you'd always be there, and then leaving. For the fact that I still care so much for your well being and pray for your happiness, even though I know you don't care if I'm alive or dead. But most of all I forgive you because you helped me realize that in life sometimes painful things happen and we cannot stay bitter. We must move on to better things, to brighter things, to better people, to brighter people. We must move on to heal, to finally see our worth, to understand that not everyone or everything I've lost was not a loss, just a lesson. To finally know what it feels like to be free of the pain, the bitterness, the resentment, the despair. To finally feel and know peace in such a hurtful situation. I forgive you. Not even for you, but for myself, and other people like me who have felt this before, and aren't yet ready to forgive for an apology they didn't truly feel they got.</p>
