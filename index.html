            <p>Would it be ok if I took some of your time? Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?<br>
                Would it be ok if I opened my heart?Would it be ok if I took on the part<br><br>
                What you've done, you've illuminated my soul.
                It's you and your love that has made me whole.
                The feel of your love, your soft touch and caress,
                We're tight, so close; your heart beats in my chest.

            <p>You're the one I can't live without.
                This fact is true, I have no doubt.
                I love the way you smile at me.
                I love the way together we're free.
                You may be strange and slightly loony,
                But all this means nothing to me,
                Because you are who you are,
                And I can see your beauty
                Inside and out,
                Which is what threw me.<br><br>
                When every day I see you,
                Till then I cannot wait.
                To know what we will go through
                Is in the hands of fate.
                The first time that I saw you,
                I knew I must steal your heart.
                I hope that it's mine forever
                And that we never do part.<br><br><hr>
                You are the one I love the most,
                And to this here fact, I propose a toast;
                May we grow old and still have fun,
                Because I love you and my heart you've won.</p>
